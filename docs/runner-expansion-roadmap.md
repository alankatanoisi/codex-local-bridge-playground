# Runner Capability Expansion Roadmap

Exploration map for growing the **cc bridge runner** toward more of the Claude Code harness — without abandoning the
playground's minimal-core, OAuth-only, local-first direction.

**Scope of this document:** categorization and phased recommendations only. No implementation commitments. Network tools
(WebFetch, WebSearch, MCP) are explicitly deferred until egress guardrails are designed.

## 1. Where we are today (honest baseline)

### Command builder coverage

The [command builder](./command-builder.html) is already a **near-complete mirror** of the runner CLI. It surfaces
essentially every flag that `bin/local-bridge-runner.js` accepts:

- Permission styles (look-only, plan-first, edit-ask, edit-auto, edit-shell)
- `--agent` profiles, `--tools` capability groups, model and budget limits
- Session store, resume/fork, ledger utilities (`--replay`, `--repair`)
- Context opt-ins (`--bare`, instruction docs, repo map, skills)
- Output formats, tracing, human log, bridge URL, caller token

**Implication:** "Expand via the command builder" means **add a runner capability first**, then wire a small control
into the builder. The HTML is not the bottleneck today.

### Model-callable tools (11 today)

| Tool          | Category         | Default visible | Gating                               |
| ------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `list_files`  | read-only        | yes             | —                                    |
| `read_file`   | read-only        | yes             | —                                    |
| `search_text` | read-only        | yes             | —                                    |
| `glob`        | read-only        | yes             | —                                    |
| `git_status`  | read-only        | yes             | —                                    |
| `edit_file`   | write            | yes             | confirmation unless `--accept-edits` |
| `write_file`  | write            | yes             | confirmation unless `--accept-edits` |
| `apply_patch` | write (advanced) | **hidden**      | opt in via `--tools apply_patch`     |
| `undo`        | recovery         | yes             | auto-approved                        |
| `undo_edit`   | recovery         | yes             | auto-approved                        |
| `bash`        | shell            | **hidden**      | `--allow-shell` required             |

### Harness infrastructure (already exists, not always exposed as tools)

Much of what feels like "missing harness" is already runner plumbing:

| Capability                       | How it exists today                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Plan mode                        | `--plan` / `--permission-mode plan`                                                 |
| Permission modes                 | `--accept-edits`, `--dont-ask`, `--permission-mode`, `--chaos-ok` combo guard       |
| Agent profiles                   | `--agent` (`explore`, `plan`, `implement`, `verify`, `test`, …)                     |
| Coordinator / workers            | `bin/local-bridge-coordinator.js`, `src/runner/coordinator.js`, `worker-runtime.js` |
| Hooks                            | `.bridge-runner/hooks.json` when `--trusted-workspace` + workspace trust            |
| Skills listing                   | `--include-skills` (discovery in system prompt)                                     |
| Auto-memory                      | `--auto-memory`                                                                     |
| Repo map / instruction hierarchy | `--include-repo-map`, `--include-instruction-docs`, etc.                            |
| Session ledger + replay/repair   | `--replay`, `--repair`, `session-ledger.js`                                         |
| Archives + transcripts           | `--transcript`, `--human-log`, `--no-archive`                                       |
| Cost / wall-clock budgets        | `--max-cost-usd`, `--max-wall-clock-ms`                                             |
| Flight recorder                  | `--trace-level`, `--trace-path`                                                     |

The runner is **smaller in tool count** but **not empty** in harness depth.

### Operability gap (honest note)

This roadmap is **feature-shaped more than failure-shaped**. We have a strong threat model (`docs/threat-model.md`) but
not yet an **operability model**: how to detect subtle runner regressions, observe cost and spawn budgets live, and
recover from a bad `--accept-edits` run without grep-ing transcripts. The
[extensions companion](./runner-expansion-roadmap-extensions.html) names these gaps explicitly; Phase 1–3 additions
below (recovery workflow, prompt registry, golden-transcript evals, budget telemetry, capability profiles) address them
without duplicating that document's full rationale.

## 2. How any new tool plugs in

Every new model-callable tool should touch the same five integration points:

1. **Implement** — `src/runner/tools/<name>.js`
2. **Register** — `TOOL_MODULES`, category, write/hidden sets in `src/runner/tool-catalog.js`
3. **Permission category** — read-only / write / shell / recovery in `src/runner/permissions.js`
4. **Capability-group summary** — progressive disclosure line in `src/runner/context-budget.js`
5. **Tests + builder** — `test/runner/<name>.test.js`, then a checkbox in `#toolChoices` and a branch in
   `buildCommandParts()` in `docs/command-builder.html`

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  model["Model emits tool_use"] --> pipeline["tool-pipeline.js"]
  pipeline --> perms["permissions.js + safety.js"]
  perms --> registry["tool-registry.js"]
  registry --> toolfile["tools/name.js"]
  catalog["tool-catalog.js"] --> registry
  budget["context-budget.js"] --> model
  builder["command-builder.html"] --> model
```

**Default posture for new tools:** read-only and visible by default; write/shell/network tools hidden and opt-in,
consistent with `docs/threat-model.md`.

## 3. Gap vs Claude Code harness

Claude Code documents ~40 built-in tools ([tools reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/tools)). Many are
**hosted-product or claude.ai-only** and irrelevant to a local OAuth lab. The table below maps **local-relevant**
gaps only.

| Claude Code tool                                                                  | Runner today                | Gap                                                         |

## 4. Phase 1 — Prudent now (local, low-risk, small)

These are the best first builds: they improve the agent loop without new egress, and each is a clean vertical slice
through catalog → permissions → tests → command builder.

### 4.1 `glob` — find files by name pattern (shipped)

**Status:** Implemented in `src/runner/tools/glob.js` (read-only, default visible).

**Why:** Complements `search_text` (content) and `list_files` (single directory). Models often need `**/*.test.js` style
discovery.

**Attainability:** Low effort. Read-only category. Mirror Claude Code Glob semantics where practical: `**` recursion,
modtime sort, cap at ~100 paths, respect `.gitignore` optionally.

**Risk:** Low — same path confinement and deny matrix as other read tools.

### 4.2 In-session task checklist (TodoWrite / Task\* analog) — shipped

**Status:** Implemented as `manage_tasks` in `src/runner/tools/manage-tasks.js` (read-only category, default visible).
Persisted in session `runner.tasks`; summarized in context budget.

**Why:** Long multi-step runs benefit from structured progress the model can update. Claude Code moved from `TodoWrite`
to `TaskCreate`/`TaskList`/`TaskUpdate`; a minimal checklist tool is enough for v1.

**Attainability:** Low–medium. No filesystem side effects. Persist in session state; mirror to transcript/human-log.

**Risk:** Low — no new permission surface beyond allowing the tool.

### 4.3 `ask_user_question` — structured clarification

**Why:** Reduces wrong assumptions before writes. Claude Code's `AskUserQuestion` is permission-free but interactive.

**Attainability:** Medium. Reuse the confirm-port pattern from `confirmation.js`. In non-interactive, `--dont-ask`, or
coordinator-worker contexts: return a safe no-op or auto-deny message (workers already use deny-all confirm port).

**Risk:** Low if TTY-gated; medium if mis-wired in CI (must fail closed).

### 4.4 `read_file` paging polish

**Why:** Large files need PARTIAL-view ergonomics like Claude Code Read (offset/limit, clear "read more" hints).

**Attainability:** Small. Extends existing tool; read-only.

**Risk:** Low.

### 4.5 `cc undo last-run` — recovery workflow — shipped

**Status:** Implemented. Per-run manifests at `.bridge-runner/runs/<run-id>/manifest.json` (written from the undo log at
every run-exit) plus the operator CLI `bin/local-bridge-undo.js` (`list-runs`, `show`, `last-run`, `run <id|session>`).
Reverts restore each file's pre-run backup; a file changed after the run is `diverged` and skipped unless `--force`;
non-interactive runs fail closed without `--yes`. The directory is keyed by run id (always unique); the session id is
stored inside so `undo run <session-id>` resolves to the most recent run of that session.

**Category:** Safety · **Effort:** Small · **Source:** [extensions §2](./runner-expansion-roadmap-extensions.html#dir-2)

**Why:** Backups and per-file `undo` / `undo_edit` already exist (`.bridge-runner/backups/` via
`src/runner/tools/file-write-utils.js`). The gap is **workflow**: after a botched `--accept-edits` run touching many
files, users must manually find backups. The runner already records edits for backup purposes — expose that as a unit.

**Minimum-viable shape:**

- Per-run manifest: `.bridge-runner/runs/<session-id>/manifest.json` listing edits and backup paths
- `cc undo last-run` — revert the most recent run's manifest (reverse edit order, diff preview, confirmation)
- `cc undo run <session-id>` and `cc undo list-runs` for older sessions
- Command-builder **recovery** tab pointing at these commands (discoverability)

**Decisions to make:** partial reverts when a later run touched the same file; inverse-diff vs full backup storage;
garbage-collection for old manifests.

**Risk:** Low — composes existing primitives; no new model-callable tools required.

### 4.6 Prompt-template registry — `.bridge-runner/prompts/` — shipped

**Status:** Implemented in `src/runner/prompts/registry.js` with built-ins under `src/runner/prompts/*.md`. Frontmatter
(`title`, `summary`, `parameters`, `recommended-tools`, `recommended-permissions`, `tags`); override order
project > global > built-in; `cc prompts list|show|validate` via `bin/local-bridge-prompts.js`; `--prompt-arg key=value`
substitution with refusal-by-default of injection-looking values. Command-builder reads a shipped registry snapshot to
suggest permissions/tools for the chosen template.

**Category:** DX · **Effort:** Small–medium · **Source:** [extensions §5](./runner-expansion-roadmap-extensions.html#dir-5)

**Why:** Patterns like `grill`, `simplify`, and `verify` are scattered as "write a markdown file" folklore (§10). At
medium scale we need listing, parameter validation, and provenance — the same treatment tools and agents already get.

**Minimum-viable shape:**

- `.bridge-runner/prompts/<name>.md` with YAML frontmatter: `title`, `summary`, `parameters`, `recommended-tools`,
  `recommended-permissions`, `tags`
- CLI: `cc prompts list`, `cc prompts show <name>`, `cc prompts validate`
- Extend `--prompt-template` with `--prompt-arg key=value` for runtime substitution
- Built-ins in `src/runner/prompts/`; user templates override by name
- Command-builder reads registry (or shipped JSON) and auto-suggests permissions/tools for the chosen template

**Decisions to make:** prompt-injection from user-supplied parameter values; flat vs composable templates; trust story
for imported templates.

**Risk:** Low — files + CLI; `--prompt-template` already exists.

### Recommended Phase 1 order

1. **`glob`** — shipped
2. **Task checklist** — shipped (`manage_tasks`)
3. **Verification presets** — shipped (`--test-watch`, `verify`/`grill`/`simplify` templates, command-builder preset)
4. **`cc undo last-run` recovery workflow** — shipped
5. **Prompt-template registry** — shipped
6. **`read_file` paging** — small polish (next priority)
7. **`ask_user_question`** — needs careful TTY/non-TTY matrix testing

---

## 5. Phase 2 — Attainable, bigger (pick one flagship)

These are worth doing but need explicit scoping and safety design.

### 5.0 File-based agent loader — shipped (slice 1)

**Status:** Implemented in `src/runner/agents/agent-loader.js` + registry wiring. Load Markdown+frontmatter agents via
`--agent <name|path>`. Curated examples in `.bridge-runner/agents/`. Compatible with the
`awesome-claude-code-subagents` format (tool/model mapping + safety gating).

### 5.1 Model-callable subagents (`spawn_agent` tool) — shipped (slice 2)

**Status:** Implemented in `src/runner/tools/spawn-agent.js`. Top-level model can call `spawn_agent` to delegate via
`WorkerRuntime`. Hidden when `spawnDepth > 0`. Permission category `orchestration` (ask by default). Capped at
8 spawns per run (`MAX_SPAWNS_PER_RUN`).

### 5.2 Future orchestration polish

Parallel/batch `spawn_agent`, background workers, and richer child result schemas. Core single-child delegation is
shipped in §5.1.

### 5.3 Git worktree isolation (`enter_worktree` / `exit_worktree`) — shipped (slice 3)

**Status:** Implemented in `src/runner/tools/enter-worktree.js` and `exit-worktree.js`. Creates an isolated
git worktree on a fresh `bridge-runner/` branch under `~/.bridge-runner/worktrees/`. Switches ctx.cwd so
all tools operate inside the worktree until exit. Permission category `worktree` (ask by default).
`cleanup=false` by default to preserve work.

**Not yet:** parallel worktree orchestration (multiple worktrees at once), automatic cleanup on session end.

**Why:** Real safety win — risky edits in an isolated worktree/branch without touching main checkout.

**Effort:** Medium. Requires git presence, cleanup on session end, clear UX when worktree already active.

### 5.4 Background bash + output polling

**Why:** Dev servers, watch builds, long tests. Claude Code uses `run_in_background` + task list.

**Build on:** `persistent-shell.js`, `subprocess-pool.js`.

**Gating:** Still `--allow-shell`. Add kill/list tools or extend `bash` schema.

**Effort:** Medium.

### 5.5 `skill` execution tool

**Why:** Runner already lists skills (`--include-skills`); execution closes the loop.

**Effort:** Medium — resolve skill paths, respect workspace trust, cap output size.

### 5.6 `LSP` code intelligence

**Why:** Jump-to-def, references, diagnostics after edits.

**Effort:** High; needs language-server lifecycle management. Defer unless a concrete language need appears.

### 5.7 Richer `Read` (images, PDF)

**Why:** Multimodal debugging, screenshot review.

**Effort:** Medium–high — depends on whether bridge `/v1/messages` accepts image/PDF content blocks with OAuth route.
Investigate before building.

### 5.8 Golden-transcript replay harness

**Category:** Evals · **Effort:** Medium · **Source:** [extensions §1](./runner-expansion-roadmap-extensions.html#dir-1)

**Why:** Refactors to `tool-catalog.js`, `permissions.js`, or `worker-runtime.js` can change tool-call shape, permission
order, or trace bytes with no automated signal — only an angry user later. Treat the runner like a compiler: replay
known-good sessions and assert equivalent runner-side behavior.

**Minimum-viable shape:**

- `test/runner/golden/` — canned transcripts: pinned model output stream + expected runner side (tools dispatched,
  permissions, files touched, trace bytes)
- `cc runner eval` — replay through a fake model client, diff actual vs expected
- CI gate: PRs touching `src/runner/` must not regress goldens without explicit approval

**Sequencing:** Land **before** budget telemetry (§5.9) and capability profiles (§6) — both refactor permission/runtime
paths and need this safety net.

**Decisions to make:** what counts as "behavior" (exit code vs full sequence vs trace bytes); path/timestamp portability;
secret redaction in goldens.

### 5.9 Budget telemetry and token caps

**Category:** Operations · **Effort:** Medium · **Source:** [extensions §3](./runner-expansion-roadmap-extensions.html#dir-3)

**Already shipped:** `--max-wall-clock-ms` and `--max-cost-usd` are enforced in `src/runner/run.js` (hard stops at loop
boundaries). Do not rebuild these.

**Still missing:**

- `--budget-input-tokens N` / `--budget-output-tokens N` — soft caps emit structured warnings; hard caps end cleanly
- Live trace event: `{ type: "budget", input_tokens, output_tokens, wall_ms, spawns, depth }` at tool boundaries
- Child agents from `spawn_agent` inherit parent's remaining budget by default; optional sub-budget carve-out later
- Command-builder **budget** panel in Permissions section

**Decisions to make:** authoritative token count (API vs local estimate); how to surface soft-cap warnings to the model;
whether hard-cap termination unwinds in-flight edits.

---

## 6. Phase 3 — Fine-grained control (later)

These need the eval harness (§5.8) in place first.

### 6.1 Composable tool capability profiles

**Category:** Safety · **Effort:** Large · **Source:** [extensions §4](./runner-expansion-roadmap-extensions.html#dir-4)

**Why:** `--accept-edits` permits all write tools; `--allow-shell` permits `bash` wholesale. Users often want narrower
scopes: `edit_file` but not `write_file`, `bash` only for `git status`, `spawn_agent` with depth cap even on trusted
roots. Today that requires custom agent profiles or over-broad flags.

**Minimum-viable shape:**

- `.bridge-runner/profiles/<name>.json` — per-tool allow/deny, optional arg-shape constraints (shell command regex,
  `write_file` size cap), human-readable rationale
- `--profile name` layered **over** existing category flags (simple story unchanged)
- Built-in profiles: `review-only`, `edit-source-no-shell`, `git-readonly-shell`, etc.
- Command-builder profile dropdown alongside permission style

**Invariants:** profiles must **not** bypass the `--chaos-ok` interlock or the hard-deny matrix (`.env`, `.ssh`, path
escapes). Denied tools should be absent or visibly marked in the model's tool list.

**Decisions to make:** deny-overrides-allow vs last-match-wins; profile composition with chaos mode.

## 7. Deferred — network surface (explicitly out of scope for now)

Per playground direction and `docs/threat-model.md` § Known limitations, outbound network is **not hard-restricted**
today (`--no-network` is a best-effort proxy guard for shell only).

| Capability  | Notes                                                                 | Revisit when                                                                   |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `WebFetch`  | Local HTTP fetch + extract; domain prompts in Claude Code             | Egress allowlists, opt-in flag (e.g. `--allow-web-fetch`), threat-model update |
| `WebSearch` | Anthropic server-side search tool; may not work on OAuth bridge route | Bridge capability audit + billing/policy clarity                               |
| MCP client  | `.mcp.json`, plugin ecosystem                                         | Trust model, `allowedMcpServers` analog, sandbox                               |

**Do not add these silently.** Each needs an explicit opt-in flag, documentation in `threat-model.md`, and command-builder
controls marked as advanced/risky.

## 8. Superfluous / out of scope for this lab

These Claude Code tools or settings areas conflict with minimal, single-user, OAuth-only runner goals:

| Item                                        | Reason                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NotebookEdit`                              | No Jupyter workflow in this runner                        |
| `PowerShell`                                | macOS-focused lab; bash covers shell                      |
| `Artifact`                                  | claude.ai hosted pages                                    |
| `CronCreate` / `CronDelete` / `CronList`    | Session scheduling on claude.ai                           |
| `RemoteTrigger` / Routines                  | claude.ai cloud                                           |
| `PushNotification`                          | Remote Control / phone push                               |
| `Workflow` / ultracode workflows            | Hosted orchestration                                      |
| Agent teams / `SendMessage`                 | Multi-agent product surface                               |
| `ShareOnboardingGuide`                      | claude.ai share links                                     |
| `ToolSearch` / deferred tool loading        | Large flat tool menus — we use capability groups instead  |
| Plugins / marketplaces / managed settings   | Enterprise distribution; use `.bridge-runner/` primitives |
| OpenAI-compatible routes / API-key fallback | Transport invariants — never restore                      |

### Explicit non-goals (decisions to say no)

From the [extensions companion](./runner-expansion-roadmap-extensions.html#nongoals) — a roadmap that says no is more
useful than one that says maybe:

| Decision | Rationale |
| -------- | --------- |
| Remove `spawn_depth = 1` cap | Threat model relies on a finite tree; solve queueing and budgets (§5.9) first |
| Remote web UI that runs the runner | Diverges from local-bridge identity; command-builder is the right UI level |
| Plugin marketplace for tools | Tools are the most security-sensitive surface; stay curated |
| Auto-apply model-suggested permission escalations | If the model asks for shell mid-run, user re-runs with broader flags; runner does not negotiate |

---

## 9. Invariants any future build must preserve

From `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `docs/threat-model.md`:

| Invariant         | Rule                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Transport         | Native `POST /v1/messages` only; OAuth Bearer upstream; no Console API-key fallback        |
| Shell             | Hidden unless `--allow-shell`; `--dont-ask` must not enable shell                          |
| Hard deny         | `.env`, `.ssh`, `.aws`, `.claude`, keys, credentials JSON, path escapes — never bypassable |
| Writes            | Confirmation unless `--accept-edits`                                                       |
| Secrets           | Scrub in tool results, transcripts, stream-json, human logs, traces                        |
| Workspace trust   | No tools until `--trust-workspace` (or interactive consent)                                |
| Default context   | Minimal (`--bare` posture); explicit opt-ins for skills, repo map, instruction docs        |
| Capability groups | Progressive disclosure in system prompt, not an ever-growing flat tool menu                |

---

## 10. Command builder — what to add when tools land

Today the builder's **Capability groups** panel (`#toolChoices`) lists all 10 tools. When Phase 1+ tools ship:

1. Add a checkbox under the appropriate group (Read / Write / Recovery / Shell / new group if needed).
2. Extend `DEFAULT_TOOL_NAMES` and `getSelectedTools()` logic.
3. Emit `--tools` only when selection differs from default (existing pattern).
4. Add one line of `<small>` help per tool (existing pattern at lines ~965–1006).

No large UI rewrite required until network or subagent tools need **risk panels** (similar to chaos-ok / shell warnings).

**Planned builder surfaces (doc-only until each direction ships):** recovery tab (`cc undo last-run`), budget panel
(token/wall caps), profile dropdown (§6.1), prompt-registry reader that auto-suggests permissions/tools (§4.6). Do not
implement builder UI ahead of the underlying runner capability.

## 11. Claude Code power user patterns — adoption map

Anthropic's [Claude Code power user tips](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/14554000-claude-code-power-user-tips)
collects workflow patterns from the Claude Code team. The article's headline advice: **verification is the single most
impactful practice** — give the agent a way to check its own output and close the feedback loop.

This section maps each major pattern from that guide to the bridge runner: what we already support, what is prudent to
build, and what belongs to the hosted Claude Code product (not this OAuth lab).

**Verdict key:**

| Verdict          | Meaning                                                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Have**         | Runner supports this today (flag, profile, or primitive)             |
| **Docs/presets** | No new runner code; document or add command-builder presets          |
| **Phase 1**      | Small local build aligned with §4                                    |
| **Phase 2**      | Bigger build aligned with §5                                         |
| **Phase 3**      | Fine-grained control aligned with §6                                 |
| **Defer**        | Network, sandbox, or policy work not ready                           |
| **Out of scope** | Hosted product, TUI polish, or conflicts with minimal-core direction |

### Verification — adopt first (article's #1 tip)

The team stresses **domain-specific verification**: tests, linters, diff checks, browser iteration for frontend. For this
runner, that translates to concrete adoption paths:

| Pattern from article                    | Runner today                                                                                    | Recommended adoption                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Run test suite after changes            | `--test-watch` (or `BRIDGE_RUNNER_TEST_WATCH=1`) + `--allow-shell` runs tests post-write (`test-watcher.js`); command-builder “Verify after edits” preset | **Shipped** — Phase 2: executable PostToolUse hooks |
| “Prove to me this works” (diff vs main) | `git_status` + `bash` when shell enabled                                                        | **Docs/presets:** `explore`/`verify` agent profiles + prompt template; no new tool                                                                                                       |
| `/simplify` (parallel review agents)    | Coordinator `verify` phase + `--agent verify`                                                   | **Phase 2:** prompt template or skill named `simplify` that invokes coordinator verify pass; optional subagent tool                                                                      |
| Chrome extension / Desktop browser      | None                                                                                            | **Out of scope** for CLI runner; revisit only if a local browser MCP lane is explicitly scoped                                                                                           |
| Stop-hook deterministic checks          | `post_tool` hook event exists; **log-only**                                                     | **Phase 2:** trusted hooks that execute allowlisted commands (e.g. `npm test`, `npm run lint`) after writes                                                                              |

**Principle to encode in presets:** every “implement” or “edit-auto” command-builder preset should nudge toward a
verification step (tests, lint, or explicit “show diff”) — matching the article even when we cannot ship a browser.

### Working in parallel

| Pattern                                                  | Adoption                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Multiple sessions in git worktrees (`claude --worktree`) | **Shipped** — `enter_worktree` / `exit_worktree` (§5.3). Parallel orchestration still Phase 2 follow-up. |
| Subagents with `isolation: worktree`                     | **Phase 2** — combines Agent tool + worktree isolation.                                                        |
| `/batch` (fan-out dozens of worktree agents)             | **Out of scope** — hosted orchestration at scale; coordinator is the lab's lighter analog.                     |
| Name/color-code sessions                                 | **Docs/presets** — use `--session-id`, `--human-log`, `--transcript`; terminal tab color is user-side.         |

### Planning and model control

| Pattern                                  | Runner today                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Start complex work in plan mode          | **Have** — `--plan`, “plan-first” command-builder preset, `--agent plan`                          |
| Re-plan when things go sideways          | **Docs** — workflow guidance; runner supports mid-session `--plan` on next run via session resume |
| Effort levels (`/effort` high/xhigh/max) | **Have** — `--effort`                                                                             |
| Opus + extended thinking                 | **Have** — `--model`; thinking depends on bridge/model policy                                     |
| Auto-name session after plan             | **Partial** — archive/transcript metadata; no auto-title UX (acceptable for CLI lab)              |

### Prompting and learning (mostly zero-code)

These patterns need **prompt templates and command-builder presets**, not new tools:

- **“Grill me on these changes…”** → add `.bridge-runner/prompts/grill.md` or extend built-in `review` template.
- **“Knowing everything you know now, scrap and implement elegantly”** → cleanup/refactor template.
- **Detailed specs before handoff** → document in quickstart; user writes spec in command-builder prompt field.
- **Explanatory / Learning output styles** → `--append-system-prompt "Explain the why behind each change"` or a dedicated template.

`/btw` (side questions without interrupting work) is a **hosted TUI feature** — out of scope unless we build an interactive runner REPL.

### CLAUDE.md, memory, compounding engineering

| Pattern                                             | Runner today                                                                                  | Adoption |

| “Update CLAUDE.md so you don’t repeat that mistake” | **Docs** — user prompt pattern; runner can write via `edit_file` when edits allowed           |
| `@claude` in GitHub PR comments (hosted bot)     | **Out of scope** — Anthropic's hosted GitHub Action / claude.ai integration; see §12 for the **local** read-only POC |
| Auto-memory (`/memory`)                             | **Have** — `--auto-memory`                                                                    |
| Per-task notes directory                            | **Docs** — point `CLAUDE.md` at `.bridge-runner/notes/`; optional auto-memory extension later |

| Repeated workflows → skills (`.claude/skills/`) | Skills **listed** with `--include-skills`; not executable           | **Phase 2** — `skill` execution tool (§5.5); lab uses `.bridge-runner/` or `.cursor/skills/` paths |
| Custom subagents (`.claude/agents/`)            | Built-in `--agent` profiles; **file loader + spawn_agent shipped** | Load via `--agent <path>`; model-callable delegation in §5.1        |
| Read-only agent (`tools: Read`)                 | **Have** — `--agent explore`, look-only preset, read-only `--tools` |                                                                                                    |
| Code-review agent team on PR open               | **Partial** — `verify` agent + coordinator                          | **Phase 2** — document coordinator recipe; no GitHub webhook in lab                                |
| Inline bash in slash commands                   | N/A (no slash UI)                                                   | **Out of scope** — use hooks or prompt templates with `--include-file` instead                     |

### Hooks — largest gap vs power-user guide

Claude Code hooks run **shell commands** at lifecycle points (e.g. PostToolUse auto-format). The runner dispatches hook
**events** but `hook-dispatcher.js` currently records matches with `action: 'log'` only — it does not execute commands.

| Hook event (article)                          | Runner event                         | Adoption                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| SessionStart — load dynamic context           | `session_start`                      | **Phase 2** — execute trusted hook commands              |
| PreToolUse — audit bash                       | `pre_tool`                           | **Phase 2**                                              |
| PostToolUse — auto-format after Write/Edit    | `post_tool`                          | **Phase 2** — high value for verification loop           |
| Stop — deterministic long-task checks         | `session_end` (closest)              | **Phase 2** — add `stop` / turn-complete event if needed |
| PostCompact — re-inject critical instructions | Compaction in `context-compactor.js` | **Phase 2** — hook after compaction ladder               |
| PermissionRequest → Slack/Opus                | None                                 | **Defer** — enterprise routing                           |

**Safety requirement for executable hooks:** same bar as shell — trusted workspace, allowlisted commands, no bypass of
hard-deny matrix, documented in `threat-model.md`.

### Permissions and safety

| Pattern                                         | Runner today                                                  | Adoption                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pre-approve `Bash(npm run *)`, `Edit(/docs/**)` | Category-level allow/ask/deny only                            | **Phase 3** — composable profiles in `.bridge-runner/profiles/` (§6.1) |
| Auto mode (classifier auto-approves safe ops)   | `--permission-mode auto` maps to `dontAsk` without classifier | **Defer** — real auto mode needs static analysis; don't fake it           |
| Sandboxing (`/sandbox`)                         | Shell-policy scanner + deny matrix; no OS sandbox             | **Defer** — large lift; document `--no-network` as weak guard             |
| Long-running uninterrupted work                 | `--max-wall-clock-ms`, `--dont-ask`, coordinator              | **Have** with caveats; **Phase 2** Stop hooks                             |
| `--dangerously-skip-permissions`                | No equivalent; `--chaos-ok` guards risky combo                | **Intentionally absent** — lab keeps explicit chaos gate                  |

### Out of scope (hosted / product UI)

Do not plan runner work for: `/loop`, `/schedule`, teleport, remote control, mobile/iMessage, plugin marketplace,
`/statusline`, `/color`, `/voice`, `/keybindings`, `/btw`, hosted GitHub `@claude` Action (PR-comment bot), `/batch`
at hundreds of agents, Artifact, or claude.ai web sessions.

**Distinct from out of scope:** §12 documents an accepted **local** read-only Actions POC (`workflow_dispatch` on
self-hosted runner) — not the hosted `@claude` bot.

### SDK and multi-repo patterns

| Pattern                                   | Runner today                                          | Adoption                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--bare` for fast non-interactive startup | **Have** — `--bare`, command-builder “minimal” preset |                                                                   |
| `--add-dir` / `additionalDirectories`     | Single `--cwd` only                                   | **Phase 2** — optional secondary read roots with same deny matrix |
| Session fork (`--fork-session`)           | **Have** — `--fork-from`, `--resume-session`          |                                                                   |
| Cloud setup scripts                       | N/A                                                   | **Out of scope**                                                  |

### How this changes phase priority

The power user guide reinforces three priorities already in this roadmap and elevates one:

1. **Verification loop** (article #1) — **shipped** for v1: `--test-watch` flag, test-watcher appendix after writes, `verify`/`grill`/`simplify` prompt templates, command-builder “Verify after edits” preset. Phase 2: executable PostToolUse hooks.
2. **Parallel safe edits** — worktrees + subagents stay Phase 2 flagships.
3. **Skills/subagents execution** — close the gap between listing and doing.
4. **Zero-code wins** — prompt-template registry (§4.6) and command-builder presets cost little and match team practices
   immediately.

## 12. Headless / CI invocation (accepted lane)

Personal research lane for invoking the runner outside an interactive terminal session. **Not** the hosted GitHub
`@claude` PR-comment bot (that remains out of scope in §8 and §11).

### Read-only Actions POC (shipped)

Documented in [bridge-runner-actions-poc.md](./bridge-runner-actions-poc.md). Workflow:
[`.github/workflows/bridge-runner-readonly-poc.yml`](../.github/workflows/bridge-runner-readonly-poc.yml).

| Property | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| Trigger | `workflow_dispatch` only — no push, PR, or schedule |
| Runner | Self-hosted on operator's Mac |
| GitHub permissions | `contents: read` |
| Bridge | `http://127.0.0.1:11437/` must be up (VS Code + Claude Local Bridge) |
| Runner flags | `--plan` + read-only tools only; no `--allow-shell`, `--accept-edits`, or `--dont-ask` |
| Artifacts | JSON output, human log, trace uploaded on success |
| Ignored paths | `actions-runner/` gitignored; skipped by file traversal |

**Policy posture:** personal research infrastructure, not Anthropic-approved production CI. OAuth credentials stay on the
self-hosted machine; the workflow does not embed API keys.

### Future hardening (not commitments)

Before any non-read-only or non-self-hosted CI use:

- Secrets handling and credential scoping for GitHub-hosted runners
- Command and branch allowlists in the workflow
- `docs/threat-model.md` update for CI invocation boundaries
- Explicit opt-in for write/shell in CI (likely never on shared runners)

---

## 13. Recommended next step

**Sequencing** (from [extensions companion](./runner-expansion-roadmap-extensions.html#summary)):

1. **Phase 1 next:** `read_file` paging (§4.4), then `ask_user_question` (§4.3) — `cc undo last-run` (§4.5) and the
   prompt-template registry (§4.6) are shipped.
2. **Phase 2 next:** golden-transcript replay harness (§5.8) **before** budget telemetry (§5.9) or capability profiles
   (§6.1) — safety net for permission/runtime refactors.
3. **Phase 2 follow-ups:** parallel worktree orchestration, background bash + polling, executable hooks, `skill` execution.
4. **Keep network tools off the table** until egress policy is designed and documented (§7).

**Shipped:** file-based agent loader (slice 1); model-callable `spawn_agent` (slice 2); git worktree isolation (slice 3);
read-only GitHub Actions POC (§12); `cc undo last-run` recovery workflow (§4.5); prompt-template registry (§4.6).

When implementation starts, update `README.md`, `docs/threat-model.md` (if safety surface changes), and
`docs/command-builder.html` in the same change set as the runner code.

## Appendix A — Runner flags not worth duplicating as tools

These are CLI/session concerns, not model tools:

- `--bare`, context opt-ins, `--agent`, permission modes
- `--session-id`, `--resume-session`, `--fork-from`
- `--trace-level`, `--human-log`, `--output-format`
- `--max-cost-usd`, `--max-wall-clock-ms`, `--effort`
- `--replay`, `--repair`, `--review-memory`

The command builder already covers them; the roadmap focus is **model-callable capabilities** and **harness parity**
where it improves the agent loop.

## Appendix B — Test coverage expectation

New tools should follow existing runner test patterns in `test/runner/`:

- Unit tests for the tool module (happy path, path denial, size limits)
- Permission matrix assertions in `permissions.test.js` or dedicated file
- Optional integration through `tool-pipeline.test.js` for confirmation/plan-mode interaction

Run before handoff:

```bash
node --require ./test/setup.js --test test/runner/*.test.js
npm run lint
npm run check:docs
```
